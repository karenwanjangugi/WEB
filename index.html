    <p style="color: white";><b>The two weeks I have spent at AkiraChix has been a bitter sweet experience for me but I like it because I want to be here and they 
        want to make the best out of me. Below is an overview of how it has been for me.</b></p>
        <h2 style="color: white"-><u>The good experiences</u></h2>
        <ol style="color: white"> 
            <li>First of all, I have to say I love the people here. Everyone from the students, to the staff, to the trainors are so nice.
                I honestly could'nt think of anyone else as self-centered as the people I met here.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I must say I like the food here. They have experienced chefs who make the food and that's pretty awesome to me. </li>
           <li>I also like the uniqueness with which everyone does everything on these grounds. It shows that the people here are quite experienced and it beats the whole 
            system where people do things just for the sake of it. </li>

<p style="color: white">In as much as I really like it here, there are also some things which make you feel pressured much. But you know what they say, "No pain no gain!!!" </p>
<h2 style="color: aliceblue;"><u>The bad experiences</u></h2>
<ul style="color: aliceblue"> 
    <li>
        First I must admit it's no walk in the park in this institution, considering the fact that they are teaching us to become professionals.
        The pressure is very high and excellence is the core value in this place. Sometimes coping with the pressure can be a challenge.
    
    </li>
    <li> The only other thing could be the intesity of the program. But one thing I know for sure, I WAS DEFINITELY MADE FOR THIS!!! </li>
